    Request Tracker with PostgreSQL database backend
	    and FullText based on trigrams
    ================================================

This is an experimental modification inspired by
http://kaiv.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/postgresql-substring-search/
I'm testing this with RT version 4.2.3.

The modification described further solves the need to be able to search
for substrings and not only whole words or other Pg FT parser tokens using
full-text PostgreSQL. For example if the ticket body contains

   The URL http://www.cisco.com/...
   ...code of the function  FooBarSample()...

and want to search the word "cisco" you need this. If you want search for
substring "foo" or "bar" etc you need this...

You need to proceed following steps:

 * Setup indexes on trigrams in the database. This can be achieved using the
   script rt-mysql2pg:

	rt-mysql2pg -v --dst-dsn dbi:Pg:dbname=rt4 --fulltext --vacuum

 * Patch the RT/Tickets.pm copy

	cd /opt/rt4	    # or where your RT instalation root is
	cp lib/RT/Tickets.pm local/lib/RT/Tickets.pm 
	patch -p1 < patch-to-patch/rt-pgsql-fttrgm.patch

 * Enable FullTextSearch in the RT_SiteConfig.pm
 
	Set(%FullTextSearch,
	    Enable     => 1,
	    Indexed    => 1,
	    Column     => 'trigrams',
	    Table      => 'Attachments',
	);

You are able to search for substrings (at least 3 characters long).
